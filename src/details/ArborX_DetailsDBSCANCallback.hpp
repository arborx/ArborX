// The algorithm is based on the the following paper:
//
//   [1] Jaiganesh, Jayadharini, and Martin Burtscher. "A high-performance
//   connected components implementation for GPUs." In Proceedings of the 27th
//   International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed
//   Computing, pp. 92-104. 2018.
//
// The general gist of the algorithm can be found on the second page and reads:
//
// ```
// ...the majority of the parallel CC algorithms are based on the following
// “label propagation” approach. Each vertex has a label to hold the component
// ID to which it belongs. Initially, this label is set to the vertex ID, that
// is, each vertex is considered a separate component, which can trivially be
// done in parallel. Then the vertices are iteratively processed in parallel to
// determine the connected components. For instance, each vertex’s label can be
// updated with the smallest label among its neighbors. This process repeats
// until there are no more updates, at which point all vertices in a connected
// component have the same label. In this example, the ID of the minimum vertex
// in each component serves as the component ID, which guarantees uniqueness. To
// speed up the computation, the labels are often replaced by “parent” pointers
// that form a union-find data structure.
// ```
//
// Union-find algorithm is sped up through path compression:
//
// ```
// Starting from any vertex, we can follow the parent pointers until we reach a
// vertex that points to itself. This final vertex is the “representative”.
// Every vertex’s implicit label is the ID of its representative and, as before,
// all vertices with the same label (aka representative) belong to the same
// component. Thus, making the representative u point to v indirectly changes
// the labels of all vertices whose representative used to be u. This makes
// union operations very fast. A chain of parent pointers leading to a
// representative is called a “path”. To also make the traversals of these
// paths, i.e., the find operations, very fast, the paths are sporadically
// shortened by making earlier elements skip over some elements and point
// directly to later elements. This process is referred to as “path
// compression”.
// ```
//
// ECL-CC makes use of an intermediate pointer jumping:
//
// ```
// Intermediate pointer jumping only requires a single traversal while still
// compressing the path of all elements encountered along the way, albeit not by
// as much as multiple pointer jumping. It accomplishes this by making every
// element skip over the next element, thus halving the path length in each
// traversal.
// ```
//
// This is encoded in `representative()` function.

  // Per [1]:
  //
  // Note that the [`representative()`] code is re-entrant and synchronization
  // free even though concurrent execution may cause data races on the parent
  // array. However, these races are guaranteed to be benign for the following
  // reasons. First, the only write to shared data is in [`parent[prev] = next;
  // `]. This write updates a single aligned machine word and is therefore
  // atomic. Moreover, it overwrites a valid entry with another valid entry.
  // Hence, it does not matter if other threads see the old or the new value as
  // either value will allow them to eventually reach the representative.
  // Similarly, all the reads of the parent array will either fetch the old or
  // new value, but both values are acceptable. The only problem that can occur
  // is that two threads try to update the same parent pointer at the same time.
  // In this case, one of the updates is lost. This reduces the code’s
  // performance as duplicate work is performed and the path is not shortened by
  // as much as it could have been, but it does not result in incorrect paths.
  // On average, the savings of not having to perform synchronization far
  // outweighs this small cost. Lastly, it should be noted that the rest of the
  // code either accesses the parent array via calls to the find_repres function
  // or changes the parent pointer of a representative vertex but never of a
  // vertex that is in the middle of a path. If the find_repres code already
  // sees the new representative, it will return it. Otherwise, it will return
  // the old representative. Either return value is handled correctly.
